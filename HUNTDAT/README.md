# HUNTDAT

This directory was taken from an install of the Carnivores 1 Demo, freely distributed and still available online. If you own a copy of the full Carnivores 1 game, you can replace this with the HUNTDAT folder and the game will automagically pick up all the new content.

The HUNTDAT/AREAS2 directory is taken from the Carnivores 2 demo.

For legal reasons I'm not distributing the full versions here.
