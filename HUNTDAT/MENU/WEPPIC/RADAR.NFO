Accessory : Radar

This allows you to view the dinosaur locations
on the map during your hunt. A dinosaur is
depicted on the map as a green dot. Your
location is shown as the red dot with the
circle surrounding it. Please note that the
map shows only the dinosaurs you are hunting.
All other dinosaurs are masked.  Use of the
map deducts 30% from your total points acquired
during that hunt.
