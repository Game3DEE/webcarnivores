Area 5: The Pyramids of Shmu-Hadron
Experience:  Advanced

This is a map for experienced hunters. These
Pyramids in the desert terrain of this area were
built by a long-gone race, and their use remains
unknown. These structures are ideal for hunting
and hiding around, but beware; predators can 
climb the pyramids too.
