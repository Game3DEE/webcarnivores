# Web Carnivores

This started as a peek into the data files of Carnivores, and quickly got out of hand. Now it is (becoming) a full reimplementation of the original Carnivores 1 game, with planned support for both Carnivores 2 and Carnivores Ice Age, and any mods made for those games.

For demonstration purposes, the data from the Carnivores 1 demo is included, but it is intended to work with any Carnivores 1/2/IceAge folder in its place.
