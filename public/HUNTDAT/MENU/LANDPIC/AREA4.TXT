Area 4: The Ancient Temple
Experience: Advanced

With only a small temple as a safe zone, this
is a map for advanced hunters. The temple, located
in the center of the island remains one of the
biggest mysteries on the planet.  Hieroglyphs
on the wall indicate a worship of the Velociraptor,
calling the beast "fast as the wind, with teeth
sharper than any blade."
