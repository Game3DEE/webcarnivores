Area 2: The Woods of Turan Choks
Experience:  Novice

A mild climate and good range of sight make this
a great beginner's map. This was the first island
explored on the new planet.  Turan Choks, named 
for the captain of the science vessel to discover 
the planet, is a hilly wooded area populated by a
variety of dinosaurs.
